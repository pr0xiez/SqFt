# Domain Glossary

Terms that show up in the code and in conversation about it. Keep updated as
concepts are added or sharpened.

## Domain Hierarchy

The core record chain is:

`Customer → Location → SiteMeasure → Estimate`

A **Customer** is a person or household. A **Location** is one of that
customer's physical sites (a customer can have several — e.g. a primary
residence and a rental). A **Site Measure** is the room-by-room measurement
taken at a location. An **Estimate** is a priced, customer-facing document
built from a site measure; a site measure can spawn several estimates (e.g. a
revision after a decline).

## Location

A physical site address belonging to a customer (`address`, optional `label`
and `notes`). Site measures hang off a Location, not directly off the
Customer, so addresses live in one place and a customer's multiple sites stay
distinct. Org-scoped like everything else. Repo: `lib/repositories/locationRepo.ts`.

## Site Measure

The measurement record for a location: a set of room measurements
(`SiteMeasureItem` rows — rect rooms with width/length, or text notes) plus a
`siteMeasureNumber`. It carries no pricing. The measurement UI lives in
`components/siteMeasures/` and `app/(app)/site-measures/`; the repo is
`lib/repositories/siteMeasureRepo.ts`.

## Estimate View

The fully-computed read model of an estimate: per-line `effectiveQty` and
`subtotal`, plus totals (`subtotal`, `markup`, `convenienceFee`, `total`,
`deposit`) and a `hasUnresolvedLines` flag.

Single source of truth for estimate math. Produced by `computeEstimateView` in
`lib/estimateView/` (`compute.ts`). Every caller — the editor
(`LineItemSection`), the customer-facing public page (`PublicEstimateView`),
the send-email route, the estimate list endpoint, and the approval snapshot —
derives its numbers from this one function so the labeled breakdown can never
diverge across surfaces.

Callers map their concrete representation (Prisma row, public payload, editor
form state) to `EstimateInput` at the seam. The Prisma adapter lives at
`lib/estimateView/fromPrisma.ts` (`fromPrismaEstimate`).

## Estimate Approval

Approval is **one-click**: the customer opens the public estimate-review page
(`/estimate-review/[token]`) and presses a single button, which POSTs to
`/api/estimate-review/[token]/approve` with no body. There is no drawn
signature, no name/email entry, and no consent text.

The approve transaction flips the estimate's status to `approved`, stamps
`approvedAt`, logs an `approved` EstimateEvent, and writes an
`EstimateApproval` row capturing `ip`, `userAgent`, and a lightweight
`snapshot` (the Estimate View + identifying metadata such as `estimateNumber`,
`date`, `customer`, and the location `address`). The snapshot is a plain JSON
record of what the customer saw — there is **no** `snapshotHash` and no
tamper-evidence hashing. Approving an estimate also supersedes any other open
estimates under the same site measure (they're marked `declined` with a
"Superseded" reason and a `system_supersede` event).

Estimate status values: `draft | sent | viewed | approved | declined`.

## API Error Codes

Every API route returns errors as `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`.
`code` is the stable machine-readable identifier; clients branch on it.
`message` is human-readable. `details` is present for validation failures and
carries the full list of Zod issues.

Standard codes:

- `UNAUTHORIZED` (401) — no session, or session has no org.
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` (400) — request body failed Zod parse. `details` holds
  the issues array.
- `NOT_FOUND` (404) — resource missing, or not visible to the caller's org.
- `CONFLICT` (409) — generic conflict; prefer a domain code below when one
  applies.
- `INTERNAL` (500) — unexpected error; the underlying cause is logged but not
  surfaced.

Domain codes:

- `ESTIMATE_LOCKED` (409) — caller tried to mutate an estimate whose status is
  `approved` or `declined`.
- `ESTIMATE_HAS_EVENTS` (409) — caller tried to delete an estimate that still
  has scheduled Events (jobs) referencing it.
- `CREW_MEMBER_IN_USE` (409) — caller tried to delete a crew member who is
  still assigned to one or more Events.
- `EMAIL_FAILED` (502) — upstream email provider rejected the send. Returned
  by the estimate-send route when Resend reports a non-OK result.

Codes are produced by throwing an `ApiError` subclass from `lib/api/errors.ts`.
Routes throw; the `apiRoute` wrapper translates to the envelope.

Clients read the envelope via `readApiError(res, fallback)` from the same
module. It returns `{ code, message, details }` with safe fallbacks if the
body isn't JSON. Use it instead of inlining `res.json()` parsing — it keeps
the wire contract in one place and gives the caller access to `code` for
branching.
